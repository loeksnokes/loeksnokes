- 👋 Hi, I’m @loeksnokes
- 👀 I’m interested in finding pure math descriptions and solutions to real world problems.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning golang, Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and as always, advanced group theory.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Pure Mathematics Research in Group Theory, and code analysis sessions.
- 📫 How to reach me: collin.bleak@st-andrews.ac.uk
